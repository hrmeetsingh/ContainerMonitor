# Container Monitor
This utility can connect to a container to monitor its state. This is still WIP and thats why no more details at the moment.

Its probably an already solved problem. I am trying this in my free time to get understanding of the tools and the approach. 
The code is generated by Claude and I have tweaked it to suit my purpose, so I do not claim any credit for this
